## Installing and using Pocket C++ ##

  1. Download and execute `pocketcpp-0.4.exe` (a self-extractor archive),
  1. select a folder to extract all files (inside the selected folder will be created the `pocketcpp` sub-folder),
  1. then double-click "`Pocket C++.bat`".
  1. Open a .cpp file and press F9 to compile it, and Ctrl+F9 to run the generated executable file.

You can delete the self-extractor. Also, all uncompressed files are portable: you can copy, move, or delete the `pocketcpp` folder.

## Does Pocket C++ modify my Notepad++ installation? ##

No. Pocket C++ includes its own (portable) Notepad++ that will be uncompressed in the specified folder of the installation. It's important that you uncompress in a new/empty folder to avoid overwriting your files.
